Dear {{ fullname }},

If you aren't a pro, setting me up, is not an easy job. Here are some tips:

1. Try and make dummy cycles: Run your dummy quotes, invoices, payments, deliveries in the system so that you can get familiar with what I can do for you.
1. Data Import Tool: You can import bulk data into me using the data import tool: via Setup > Data > Data Import Tool
1. Help me make more friends: Add more users via Setup > Users and Permissions > User

If you need help or are stuck, [head to the user forum](https://discuss.frappe.io) or [read my manual](https://manual.erpnext.com).

Best of luck!
